kinda messy

Here's how this works.
A packet for the watch sync looks like this:
FF 31 16 03 94 34 01 07 DA 01 17 06 1E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
You have the first four bytes which we're just going to ignore.
The 5th byte represents the hour you want to sync to.
The 6th byte represents the minute you want to sync to.
The 7th byte represents the second you want to sync to.
The 9th byte represents the year you want to sync to.
The 10th byte represents the month you want to sync to.
The 11th byte represents the day you want to sync to.
THe 14th and 15th bytes represent the temperature in celcius.
The 16th and 17th bytes represent the altitude in meters.

It also stores some of these values in some unusual (to me) ways.

For hour, the value 0x80 needs to be added to the 24hr representation of the desired
hour to sync to.

For year the value 0x700 needs to be subtracted from the desired year to sync to.

For temperature, the temperature (in celcius) needs to be multiplied by 0x0A.

Caveat emptor: There is no error checking implemented to check for valid ranges.
